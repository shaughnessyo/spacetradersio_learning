            symbol (ShipFrameSymbol): Symbol of the frame.
            name (str): Name of the frame.

                module take up a number of slots, and once there are no more slots, no new modules can be installed.
            mounting_points (int): The amount of slots that can be dedicated to mounts installed in the ship. Each installed
                mount takes up a number of points, and once there are no more points remaining, no new mounts can be installed.
            fuel_capacity (int): The maximum amount of fuel that can be stored in this ship. When refueling, the ship will
                be refueled to this amount.
